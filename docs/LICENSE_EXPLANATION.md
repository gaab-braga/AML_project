## Apache 2.0 vs Other Licenses

### vs MIT License
- **Similarity**: Both allow commercial use and modification
- **Apache 2.0 Advantage**: Patent protection built-in
- **MIT Advantage**: Shorter, simpler text

### vs Proprietary License (Previous)
- **Apache 2.0**: Maximum community engagement, open collaboration
- **Proprietary**: Maximum control, commercial protection
- **Decision**: Choose Apache 2.0 for portfolio/career building

### vs GPL License
- **Apache 2.0**: Can be included in proprietary software
- **GPL**: Forces derivative works to be open source too
- **Decision**: Apache 2.0 is more business-friendly

## Legal Considerations

### Disclaimer
This license provides basic copyright protection but is not a substitute for 
legal advice. For serious commercial deployment, consider:

1. **Consult an IP lawyer** for jurisdiction-specific protection
2. **File for copyright registration** (strengthens legal standing)
3. **Add patent protection** for novel algorithms (if applicable)
4. **Non-disclosure agreements** for sensitive discussions

### Third-Party Components

The LICENSE includes acknowledgment of third-party algorithms:

```
This Software includes research implementations of third-party algorithms 
(XGBoost, LightGBM, Graph Neural Networks) for academic comparison purposes. 
Original algorithm copyrights remain with their respective owners.
```

This is important because:
- XGBoost, LightGBM have their own licenses (Apache 2.0)
- PyTorch Geometric has BSD license
- You acknowledge using these libraries
- You claim copyright on YOUR code, not the libraries

---

## Badge Explanation

The README badge shows:

```markdown
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Proprietary-red.svg)](LICENSE)
```

**"Proprietary"** clearly indicates:
- Not open source
- Copyright protected
- Controlled access
- Professional/commercial nature

**Red color** is standard for proprietary licenses (indicates restriction)

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I keep the code on public GitHub with this license?
**A**: Yes. Public repository ≠ open source. Many companies have public proprietary repos.

### Q: Do I need to register copyright?
**A**: No. Copyright exists automatically upon creation. Registration strengthens legal protection.

### Q: What if someone violates the license?
**A**: You have legal recourse (cease and desist, DMCA takedown, lawsuit). Consult a lawyer.

### Q: Can I grant specific permissions?
**A**: Yes. You can write custom license agreements for specific individuals/companies.

### Q: Does this affect IBM dataset usage?
**A**: No. The IBM dataset license is separate. You have rights to YOUR code, not the data.

## Comparison with Academic Projects

### Academic Project (Typical)
- License: Often MIT or Creative Commons
- Goal: Share knowledge, get citations
- Protection: Minimal (open for use)

### Your Project (Professional Portfolio)
- License: Proprietary Copyright
- Goal: Demonstrate skills, protect IP
- Protection: Maximum (controlled access)

**Why Different?**: Your project shows production-ready ML engineering, not just research. 
It has commercial value.
